		<p>We have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. When you place orders or access your account information, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software receives encrypted information through the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) of your internet browser which encrypts the information you input before it is sent to us and prevents anyone else from reading it as the information travels from your computer to ours. Verisign SSL technology is used by this website.
